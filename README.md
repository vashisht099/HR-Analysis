# HR-Analysis

The purpose of this HR analysis project is to address real-life challenges faced by HR departments. Utilizing a dataset consisting of employee attendance records, the project aims to uncover key insights that can inform critical HR decisions.

The two primary objectives of this analysis are to:
1. Determine the working preferences of employees in regards to working from home versus working from the office.
2. Evaluate the prevalence of sick leaves, including full and half-day absences, over a specific time period.

In today's fast-paced business environment, it is crucial for companies to stay informed about the wellbeing of their employees and to make informed decisions that enhance their productivity and satisfaction. 

In addition to understanding the preferences and wellbeing of employees, this analysis also provides valuable information that can inform effective resource planning for the company. By analyzing the working preferences of employees and understanding their leave taking trends, the company can make informed decisions about resource allocation and effectively plan for personnel availability. This proactive approach to resource planning can lead to improved efficiency, productivity, and overall success of the organization.
